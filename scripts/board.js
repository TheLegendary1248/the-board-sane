//Placeholder js file for the board page logic

//TODO Keep accessibility in mind, especially avoiding keyboard traps considering I want to use the heck out of shortcuts

/* THE PLAN

Types of board content

1. Note
 ----------------
| Shopping List  |
|   Eggs         |
|   Milk         |
------------------
A simple draggable text box. Remember Html has drag and drop features

2. Scribble
      __
\    /  \
 \_  \__/
   \__/\_
         \___
             `-=>

3. Path
