# The Board  
A website application intended to be like Ever Note, One Note, Milanote and Trello  

Technologies Used
Front End: React*
Back End: Node JS

Packages I Remember Using
- uuid : For 'unique' token id. As of writing this, i just searched up and found out about JS's built in interface for cryptographically strong keys. Dammit
- cookie-parser : Addon package to express, for accessing cookies server side


\* React _is_ used, but as of right now, is SSR using `express-react-views`
